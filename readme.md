# PowerShellModulesCentral

This repository was founded as a central hub to a list of PowerShell modules that people know/use.
Each module has a file describing its name, basic information the module, as well as one or more blog posts/videos from people that have written about or used them.

This way we can reduce friction when people are starting out or are trying to solve similar problems

## Why?
When a new module appears on the PowerShell scene it can be difficult to advertise and gain mindshare among developers/end users who could be interested in it.
There are also times when difficulties arise in finding if a good tool exists or not, if its up to date, and how relevant it is in the community.

This happened to me recently:
I went to google, found a PowerShell Gallery script, and after checking that the script didn't work with some particulars I did a further research and found (google result's - page 3 or 4) a comment on a forum pointing to the GitHub repository. Guess what? The problem I was having were already addressed. ;-)

Are you a module owner? Are you writing something new? Do you contribute to a module? Share it!
The ones I know and use could be very different from the ones you know and use! Why not share?

## How can this help me?
Are trying to find a module to work on a specific task? Use the search on the top of the page to try to find what you need.
* Working with Windows? Type "windows".
* Working with SQL Server? Type "SQL Server".
* Do you know the author's name? You can search that way too.
* Have you read a blog post before and just remember one word or the blogger's name? Type it and see what you find.
