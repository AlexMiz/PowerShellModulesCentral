# PowerShellModulesCentral

The intent of this repository is to make available on a central place a list of modules that people know/use.
Each module has his file with his name with some basic information and a list of blog posts from people that have written/used them.

This way people can have some starting point to find solutions for similar problems.

## Why?
Once in a while a new module appears and can be hard to spread the word an reach most of the people that could be interested in it. 
Also, sometimes is difficult to find if a tool already exists or not, or if we are looking to latest version. This happened to me recently I went to google, found a PowerShell Gallery script and after checking that script don't work with some particularities I did a further research and found (google result's - page 3 or 4) a comment on a forum pointing to the GitHub repository. Guess what? The problem I was having were already addressed. ;-)

Are you a module owner? Are you writing something new? Do you contribute to a module? Share it!
The ones I know and use can be very different from the ones you know and use! Why not share this information?

## How to contribute
Just fork this repository, add the information and send a pull request (PR).
I will merge it once everything is OK.

If you find that module already exists, you just need to add your URLs and any other information to be updated, tags that you think may be useful, add something to description, etc.
